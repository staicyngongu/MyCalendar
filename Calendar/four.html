    	<h1>The world is aquiver. 
			Shaking. Blurring at the edges. 
			I can’t tell up from down. 
			I’m not sure if I’m breathing. 
			A claustrophobic, blinding light ensnares the universe. 
			I choke as I am pulled apart, as I slowly explode from the inside out… 
			The pain is unbearable, building, building, building --! 
			A scream is torn from my chest. 
			Quickly, shadow falls, washing away the blinding sharpness of the sky. 
			A moment of silence.
			<br> 
			Then everything shatters. </h1>
