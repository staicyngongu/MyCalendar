    	<h1>At my high school (6th form) building a playgroup. Played with the 
    	kids there. Behind was temples and the pyramids where there were booby 
    	traps but a mall inside. Started collecting snacks with people and then 
    	some revolution happened and the bad spirit inside was defeated and we 
    	got to leave with all our food.  </h1>
