    	<h1> I was holding a little girl who was my sister at the beginning of 
    	the dream and then changed into my daughter. The whole dream we spoke to 
    	each other in Japanese. We were in prestige shopping center (a childhood mall) 
    	and I was looking for snacks for us to share. She suddenly went missing after I put 
    	her down. I stressed a lot trying to find her shouting at the manager and running
    	up and down the shopping center asking people. I found her at the end with 
    	an elderly woman and she ran over and hugged me crying.
