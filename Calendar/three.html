     <h1> I was in my highschool with my childhood friends from prepschool and we 
    	were all heading to the field for P.E but I didn't have socks on so I wanted 
    	to head back to sixth form to look through my bag. Suddenly the walk back felt 
    	like it was miles away and we were on a quiet street with no proper roads but
    	a housing area. My best-friend and I came across an airport on our way and decided
    	to try and enter. We entered the compound which had a large plane in the middle 
    	with stairs leading inside of it. I climbed the stairs and headed inside however 
    	the stairs were not stable and started to fall... this is when I realized I was 
    	just dreaming and closed my eyes knowing I would not get hurt. 
    	I stood up and ran out with my friends and ran back to our P.E class which we 
    	were late for and had to change later than everyone else.
